#GUESS WHERE THE PICTURE IS

This is a simple strategy game for every ages. The logic of the game is to guess behind what square the picture is hidden on the board. Before to start a game, a player sees a blank game board with navigation tools bars, design elements. At the top right corner there is a navigation 
tool bar witn the next button: play(pop-up menu with a different level of the game react on hover), instruction(pop-up menu react on hover), history of the game(pop-up menu react on hover). 
Player has two scenerio to start the game: pressing the _start_ button intuitively placed at the middle of the sreen above(by default entry level) or to choose the game's level using a menu button and press **start** button. After pressed start button a player is showed by 10 squared pictures faced up for a 3 seconds(entry level, 2 and 1 seconds for more advanced levels or it could be version of the game where a player has to make a guess on the strict order). At this time board stays inactive to interact. After time runs out all pictures turned off. Board becomes interactive for a player and he is able to make a choice by click on the appropriate square on a board. When the square field is clicked it turned on. In case if the choice was right a player see the picture as a square background and pop massage "Right choice. Go on!". Making the right choice player get points. Sooner he devide the right square more points he gets. With each false choice he get less points. Score is stored and showed use at the end of the game.
At any stage of the game a player has an option to press a buttom **reset** and end up the game beforehand. At this point all progress will be ignored and user get a additional warning message 'are you sure.'
A player has a limitided range of steps depending on the level. If a player exceeds these scopes and didn't open all right squares, he looses, otherwise a player wins and get a congratulation pop up message on the screen.
